# Data

In this chapter we describe the dataset underlying the Shiny application:  
**Anderson (2016), Arizona – *Hilaria belangeri*.**

---

## Source

The dataset comes from long-term vegetation monitoring by Anderson (2016).  
It includes mapped polygons of individual *Hilaria belangeri* plants in Arizona grasslands, with repeated observations over multiple years.  

Each record corresponds to a plant genet in a given year, including:

- **track_id**: unique identifier of the genet  
- **quad**: quadrat within the site  
- **year**: observation year  
- **basal_area_genet**: size at time *t₀*  
- **size_tplus1**: size at time *t₁*  
- **survives_tplus1**: survival status  
- **geometry**: spatial polygon of the genet
