# Introduction

This booklet documents the Shiny application built for the dataset:  

**Anderson (2016), Arizona – *Hilaria belangeri*.**

The interactive visualizations allow you to:
- Explore plant growth and survival through time
- Filter individuals by site, quadrat, and year
- Mark and track "misfit" individuals
- Visualize spatial polygons of plants in both year *t₀* and *t₁*
