## Abstract
Reports on Moore et al. 2021 with insights on progess and decition-making towards building species specific IPM's

## Publication
[Moore et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3661) conducted a study on southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems near Flagstaff, Arizona, USA, examining plant demography data over a 19-year period (2002â€“2020). The study provides annual mapping of these ecosystems, offering valuable insights into plant population dynamics. The data collected during this extensive period can be accessed through the [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/records/5567814)

## Main
The dataset stands out due to its unique folder structure and the distinct nature of the data it contains. Specifically, we used geospatial data provided by Moore. 

To handle the small observations, we manipulated the data by using centroids, as these observations were quite granular. By doing so, we grouped them into a newly defined smallest category. 

Additionally, the dataset differs in how plants are categorized. Instead of using growth form as the categorization method, it relies on geospatial data that captures density and cover information, providing a more nuanced view of the plant distribution.
